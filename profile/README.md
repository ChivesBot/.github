# ChivesBot

ChivesBot is a GitHub + Slack app to bring you relevant notifications from GitHub in Slack.

We got frustrated with GitHub's official Slack integration.

It's unmaintained. Feature requests have been open for years with plenty of upvotes, but there hasn't been any love from GitHub.

Why can't you create Slack notifications for only deployments to production?

Why can't you mute pull-request notifications that were created by bots such as Dependabot?

We're building something better.

At it's core, we want more flexibility when creating notifications than the official integration.
